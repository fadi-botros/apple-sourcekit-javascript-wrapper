# apple-sourcekit-javascript-wrapper
A JavaScript wrapper for Apple's SourceKit for use with Node.JS (the wrapper is written in C++).

# Status
Still isn't complete, now just prints your request.

# TODO
- Make real requests to SourceKit, in the form of JavaScript Promises.
- Make those Requests cancellable.
- Clean the code.
- Linux support (works now on macOS with Xcode installed only).

# Notes
- Header files are taken from SourceKit itself, no new header files.

# Goal
- To make Apple's SourceKit usable from JavaScript (for use with JavaScript based editors for example).

# LICENSE
- Apache License
